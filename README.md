 to
 hack the planet to secure!!! 😉
 
### How to install
1. ``git clone https://github.com/abhhi-101/autohack.git``
1. ``cd autohack``
1. run ``bash requirements.sh``

### How to Use
1. ``cd autohack``
2. ``chmod +x autohack.sh && sudo cp autohack /bin``
3. ``autohack.sh -d target.com``

### what in target.txt
1. google.com  --> names of target root domains
2. yahoo.com   --> mutiple targets at a time

### how it works
autohack.sh takes 1 root domain as target.com :
1. find all the subdomain and save it in ~/project/target.com/domains directory
2. then it scan all the subdoamins for vulnerability and saves it in scan directory
3. then it will take the screen shots for home page of all subdomain found so you can priorities which subdomain to test for vuln first
& many more
